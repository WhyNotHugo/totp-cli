totp-cli is a simple command line application to generate OTP tokens for two
factor authentication using RFC6238_.

.. _RFC6238: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6238

These are compatible with many popular services such as facebook, github,
google, eve-online, battle.net, etc.

totp-cli fetches your shared key (aka: code) from pass_, generates the
token, outputs it to stdout and copies it to your CLIPBOARD X selection.
Default X selection can be overidden with the PASSWORD_STORE_X_SELECTION
environment variable.

Shared keys should be stored in your pass storage under ``2fa/SERVICE/code``,
for example ``2fa/github/code``. The add command can be used to add this less
painfully

.. _pass: http://www.passwordstore.org/

Usage
-----

Usage::

    totp SERVICE

For example::

    $ totp github
    621787

You don't need to run ``totp`` from the command line if you just want to paste
the code; you can run if from ``dmenu``, or whatever your application launcher
is.

About pass entries
------------------

Pass entries are expected to have the TOTP secret in their first line (as
provided by the third party).
The amount of digits token must have (for example, battle.net uses 8), must be
provided in a separate line, with a format like:

    Digits: 8

For the moment, only customizing the token length is possible.

Requirements
------------

 * `pass <http://www.passwordstore.org/>`_
 * `xclip <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip>`_
 * `python <https://www.python.org/>`_


Installation
